### Description

This program acts as a calculator for Special Relativity problems ranging from Length Contraction and Time Dilation to Relativistic Velocity Transformation Equations. This is all based on the Lorentz Equations and Einsteins Theory of Special Relativity.
 
### More Info
 
For any type of problem you need to have specific values such as V (Velocity), X2 (X coordinate), X2'(X prime coordinate), T2 (T coordinate), T2' (T prime coordinate), Ux, Ux' (both for RVT Calculations) and these values will help you figure out your unknowns. A special list will contain the variables needed which you have not inputted yet for a specific calculation.

Before using this code you should definitely understand Special Relativity in concept at least. This program is made for the Intermediate coder, but the Advanced Special Relativity User.

This will help you to solve any of your SR Problems.

There are no "side-effects" that are known of.
